Hi.

To run this application, be sure that the Project Build Target is set to Google APIs v10 (2.3.3). It may default to Android 2.3.3 instead, which will create some build errors (namely in Locale, LocaleOverlay, and TourGuideMapActivity, as they use the Google API).

Otherwise, everything else should work smoothly. Enjoy!!
